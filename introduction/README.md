# Introduction to Python Type Hints

Python's dynamic typing has long been both a blessing and a curse for developers. While offering flexibility and rapid development cycles, it can lead to runtime errors and make code harder to understand and maintain. Type hints, introduced in Python 3.5 through PEP 484, provide an elegant solution by allowing developers to indicate expected types without sacrificing Python's dynamic nature.

This repo explores Python type hints from basic usage to advanced applications, with special focus on their critical role in AI agent development.
